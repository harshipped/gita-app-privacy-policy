Privacy Policy – Bhagavad Gita Daily Shloka App
Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

📥 Data We Collect
We collect and store the following data only on your device:

Your preferred language

Favorite shlokas

Notification preferences

We do not collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location.

🔔 Notifications
We request your permission to send daily reminder notifications at 6 AM.
These are delivered using Expo’s push notification service, which requires a unique device token (a technical identifier).

If you tap on a notification, the app may open a specific shloka (verse) based on the content of the notification.

⚙️ How We Use the Data
All data is used solely for app functionality, including:

Displaying your favorite shlokas

Sending daily reminders

Saving your language and notification preferences

We do not use your data for analytics, advertising, or tracking.

🔄 Data Sharing
We do not share any user data with third parties for marketing or analytics.

However, to deliver push notifications, we use the Expo SDK, which may:

Transmit a unique device identifier to Expo servers

Collect anonymous technical logs (e.g., crash reports or device type)

This technical data is used only to improve performance and reliability.

🗑️ Data Control and Deletion
You can delete all stored data at any time by:

Uninstalling the app

Clearing app data via your device settings

We do not store any data on our own servers.
